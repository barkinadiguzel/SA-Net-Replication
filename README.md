# SA-Net-Replication
SA-Net-Replication is a modular PyTorch implementation of Shuffle Attention (SA) for deep convolutional neural networks, designed to integrate channel and spatial attention efficiently. It provides a clear structure for experimenting with SA blocks within ResNet backbones and visualizing their effect on feature representations.
